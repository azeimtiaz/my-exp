# My Exp

A personal expense-tracking mobile application built with Flutter. 

## Features

The app allows users to enter their daily expenses and keep track of their weekly expeditures.


A transaction detail can be added manually. The app also allows users to upload the receipt of a transaction from the galllery, or capture from the device camera, which will then be processed by a pre-trained OCR Model which extracts and returns the transaction details as text (transaction date, total amount, merchant name).
